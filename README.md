# Prodigi Sign Up Page

Hi Stuart, this is my attempt at the technical test. I tried to follow the design best I could.

I really enjoyed doing this one actually and it gave me a chance to have a go with Tailwind CSS.

Let me know what your thoughts are and any further queries you may have.

Thanks, Tom.
